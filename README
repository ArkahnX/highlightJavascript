Usage:

include the following in <head>
<link href="highlightJavascript.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="highlightJavascript.min.js"></script>

highlightJavascript includes javascript language highlighting built right in, but you can view the language file at language/javascript.js to build your own.
